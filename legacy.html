		Shortly after the Easter Rising, poet Francis Ledwidge wrote "O’Connell Street" and "Lament for the Poets of 1916", which both describe his sense of loss and an
		expression of holding the same "dreams", as the Easter Rising's Irish Republicans. He would also go on to write lament for Thomas MacDonagh for his fallen
		friend and fellow Irish Volunteer. A few months after the Easter Rising, W. B. Yeats commemorated some of the fallen figures of the Irish Republican movement, as
		well as his torn emotions regarding these events, in the poem Easter, 1916.
		<br>
		<br>
		Some of the survivors of the Rising went on to become leaders of the independent Irish state. Those who were executed were venerated by many as martyrs; their
		graves in Dublin's former military prison of Arbour Hill became a national monument and the Proclamation text was taught in schools. An annual commemorative
		military parade was held each year on Easter Sunday. In 1935, Éamonn de Valera unveiled a statue of the mythical Irish hero Cú Chulainn, sculpted by Oliver
		Sheppard, at the General Post Office as part of the Rising commemorations that year - it is often seen to be an important symbol of martyrdom in remembrance of
		the 1916 rebels.
		<br>
		<br>
		The parades culminated in a huge national celebration on the 50th anniversary of the Rising in 1966. Medals were issued by the government to survivors who
		took part in the rising at the event. RTÉ, the Irish national broadcaster, as one of its first major undertakings made a series of commemorative programmes for
		the 1966 anniversary of the Rising. Roibéárd Ó Faracháin, head of programming said, "While still seeking historical truth, the emphasis will be on homage, on
		salutation."[168] At the same time, CIÉ, the Republic of Ireland's railway operator, named several of its major stations after republicans who played key roles in
		the Easter Rising.
		<br>
		<br>	
		Ireland's first commemorative coin was issued at the same time to pay tribute to the Easter Rising. It was valued at 10 shillings, therefore having the highest
		denomination of any pre-decimal coin. The coin featured a bust of Patrick Pearse on the obverse and an image of the statue of Cú Chulainn in the GPO on the reverse.
		Its edge inscription reads, "Éirí Amach na Cásca 1916", which translates to, "1916 Easter Rising". Due to their 83.5% silver content, many of the coins were melted
		down shortly after issue.
		<br>
		<br>
		With the outbreak of the Troubles in Northern Ireland, government, academics and the media began to revise the country's militant past, and particularly the Easter
		Rising. The coalition government of 1973–77, in particular the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Conor Cruise O'Brien, began to promote the view that the violence
		of 1916 was essentially no different from the violence then taking place in the streets of Belfast and Derry.
		<br>
		<br>
		O'Brien and others asserted that the Rising was doomed to military defeat from the outset, and that it failed to account for the determination of Ulster Unionists
		to remain in the United Kingdom
		<br>
		<br>
		Irish republicans continue to venerate the Rising and its leaders with murals in republican areas of Belfast and other towns celebrating the actions of Pearse and
		his comrades, and annual parades in remembrance of the Rising. The Irish government, however, discontinued its annual parade in Dublin in the early 1970s, and in
		1976 it took the unprecedented step of proscribing (under the Offences against the State Act) a 1916 commemoration ceremony at the GPO organised by Sinn Féin and
		the Republican commemoration Committee. A Labour Party TD, David Thornley, embarrassed the government (of which Labour was a member) by appearing on the
		platform at the ceremony, along with Máire Comerford, who had fought in the Rising, and Fiona Plunkett, sister of Joseph Plunkett.
		<br>
		<br>
		With the advent of a Provisional IRA ceasefire and the beginning of what became known as the Peace Process during the 1990s, the official view of the Rising grew
		more positive and in 1996 an 80th anniversary commemoration at the Garden of Remembrance in Dublin was attended by the Taoiseach and leader of Fine Gael, John Bruton.
		In 2005, the Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, announced the government's intention to resume the military parade past the GPO from Easter 2006, and to form a committee to
		plan centenary celebrations in 2016. The 90th anniversary was celebrated with a military parade in Dublin on Easter Sunday, 2006, attended by the President of
		Ireland, the Taoiseach and the Lord Mayor of Dublin. There is now an annual ceremony at Easter attended by relatives of those who fought, by the President, the
		Taoiseach, ministers, senators and TDs, and by usually large and respectful crowds.
		<br>
		<br>
		In December 2014 Dublin City Council approved a proposal to create a historical path commemorating the Rising, similar to the Freedom Trail in Boston. Lord Mayor of
		Dublin Christy Burke announced that the council had committed to building the trail, marking it with a green line or bricks, with brass plates marking the related
		historic sites such as the Rotunda and the General Post Office.
